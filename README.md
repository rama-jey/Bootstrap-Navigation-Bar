# Bootstrap-Navigation-Bar
# Description:
This single page application has a navigation bar incorporated in Bootstrap method, is really a time saver and a lot fun to do. This navigation bar has Sign In, Mission and About links. When you click on each link it displays the content of that page. I also added screenshots of the Sign in and Home page for reference.
# How to Run:
Download all the files and open the bootstrap_nav.html in your browser (Chrome browser recommended) to view the links and the pages.
